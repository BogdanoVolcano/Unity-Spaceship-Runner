# unity.actors.Spaceship-Runner
This project was created with [Actors Framework](https://github.com/PixeyeHQ/actors.unity). Actors favors simplicity and doesn't try to "abstract away" Unity workflows bringing first-class support for combining ECS with classic Unity component system.
## Recommended to run on Unity version 2020.1.10f1 or older.

In this project I use [Odin Inspector](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041) plugin. This plugin isn't free, so please buy it and import to your cloned project by yourself.
