# unity.actors.Spaceship-Runner
This project was created with [Actors Framework](https://github.com/PixeyeHQ/actors.unity). Actors favors simplicity and doesn't try to "abstract away" Unity workflows bringing first-class support for combining ECS with classic Unity component system.
## Recommended to run on Unity version 2020.3.3f1
